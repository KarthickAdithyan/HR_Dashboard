# Abstract

A general overview of the role that analytical methods can play in evaluating several aspects of human resource management, including staff recruitment and retention, compensation and benefits, and skill inventories. The creation of a specialised analytics Dashboard for this organisation that focuses on strategy and human resources management is the purpose of this report. The directors and senior officials of the organization's management team should be able to rely on it for assistance when putting their strategic decisions into action.

# Introduction

Decision-making in businesses is complicated and depends on credible data in a competitive and connected environment. Firms and HR managers are under pressure to respond quickly to the changing business environment. Businesses try to reconstruct their structures and reinvent their practises and processes. Analytics can help in some cases. According to the literature, most organisations that have embraced Analytics can make better decisions faster. Businesses restructure, redefine, and streamline their operations. In some cases, analytics inform decisions. According to the literature, firms that embrace Analytics can make faster, more accurate decisions. According to research (Wawer and Muryjas, 2016), the human mind's ability to make optimal business decisions is insufficient in an era of rising data and sophisticated analytical needs. Analytics becomes a significant tool that blends business and IT, delivering crucial data to decision-makers via simulations and scenarios to optimise organisational development and forecast business results and customer behaviour. Empower HR leaders to build effective plans by offering them access to a wide range of workforce-related data to aid in planning, simulate planning circumstances, and evaluate real performance compared to plan to make better strategic judgements. Organizations can change their aims and objectives, change their programmes, and reallocate their resources and cash. In essence, performance metrics serve as a feedback loop in the process of managing corporate performance.
# What is HR dashboard?

A business analytics tool called an HR dashboard allows teams in the HR Department to monitor, evaluate, and report on HR key performance indicators (KPIs). Utilizing an HR analytics platform, modern interactive dashboards make it simple to combine data from many systems and conduct in-depth analysis of that data from within the dashboard. This makes it possible for HR departments to quickly find insights that might enhance hiring, optimise workplace management, and raise employee productivity. In order to make the shift from analogue to digital, HR companies need to adopt fresh technology that will let them reinvent themselves and keep up with rapid changes in the fiercely competitive market for luring, keeping, and growing talent (Goldstein, 2015). The execution of business operations via the use of electronic forms has become essential to a company's success. Like all other company tasks, the Human Resources (HR) job is becoming increasingly computerised. This improvement made it possible for HR managers to utilise the data in every manner imaginable to create better HR metrics for the company. As organisations want to evaluate the performance of all functional areas in realistic terms, the creation of new HR metrics has become crucial; supported measures are the only way to demonstrate this. An organization's most important resource is its workforce. HR dashboards that are interactive and persona-based leverage an HR analytics platform that lets users see data directly from the dashboard.

# HR Dashboard KPIs

Reviewing and analysing the IBM workforce may be done in a more expedient and well-organized manner if the appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) are used. The following is a list of the metrics that we need to take into consideration for the four primary categories that are workforce management, attrition, remuneration, and recruiting respectively. Workforce Management KPIs: • Employee satisfaction rate • Training ROI • HR effectiveness • Worker composition by gender, experience, and tenure • Time to productivity • Promotion rate • Absenteeism rate Compensation KPIs: • Labour cost revenue percent • Revenue per FTE • Profit vs. compensation per FTE • Human capital ROI • HR functional cost per employee Recruitment KPIs: • Quality of hire • V acancy rate • Turnover rate • Resignation/retirement rate • Diversity • Experience • Gender hire ratio • Retention rate • Retirement rate forecast Therefore, we created an HR analytical dashboard that can aid in increasing data literacy within the company, encourage a culture of innovation and discovery, and empower employees at all levels to gain a competitive edge. If we have trustworthy and well-organized data, we can make better and quicker judgments, which is possible. We have therefore obtained data from Kaggle. The IBM data scientists produced the dataset. Nearly 1500 current and former employees are included in the data, along with details about their tenure, experience, salary, and demographics, as well as information about their job satisfaction and work-life balance. Here is a quick summary of the data along with some summary statistics.
